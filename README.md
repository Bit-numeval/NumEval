# Numerical Sensitivity Enhancing and Reasoning Completeness Alignment for Quantitative Understanding
This system is designed to complete the task7 of the [SemEval2024]（https://sites.google.com/view/numeval/numeval），the performance of our system can be found in [overview paper] (https://sites.google.com/view/numeval/numeval#h.kjhrdjtve3l).

An overview of our system: (1) supervised fine-tuning with comparing numbers task for numerical sensitivity enhancement, (2) reward model training. (3) reinforcement learning via proximal policy optimization
with Reasoning Completeness Reward.
