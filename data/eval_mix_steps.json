As of August 2021, the estimated American population is approximately 331 million people.\n    [3.2]. 64.1% of 331 million is calculated as (64.1/100) * 331 million, which is approximately 212.271 million.\n    [3.3].

The farm has a total of 12,880 ounces of horse food per day, and each horse is fed 230 ounces of horse food per day.3. We can entailment that the number of sheep is 6 times the number of horses, since the ratio is 6 to 7. Let's denote the number of horses as 'h'.4. The total number of ounces of horse food consumed per day is 12,880 ounces, which can be expressed as 230h + 6*h = 12,880 ounces.5. Simplifying the equation from step 4, we have 230h + 6h = 12,880, which gives 290h = 12,880.6. To find the number of horses 'h', we divide both sides of the equation by 290: h = 12,880/290 = 45.34.

The reasoning behind this inference is that the premise states a fact (Tevante Clark's weight of 405 pounds) and defines a category (morbidly obese with a BMI of 40 or greater). Since Tevante Clark falls into this category, we can conclude that he is morbidly obese </s><s>4.  [Final solution] Hence, the correct answer is option 1, and the inference process is \"The premise states that Tevante Clark's weight of 405 pounds is equivalent to a BMI of 40.5, which is considered morbidly obese. Therefore, it is entailment that Tevante Clark is morbidly obese\". #### 1",
